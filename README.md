# ASP.NET-MVC5-Capturing-System
This is a class project I had to do using ASP.NET MVC5, where facilitators can use the system to add new students to the register, edit their details and delete once they have dropped out or de-registered. 
All the information is stored and can be retrieved and updated on a SQL database.
